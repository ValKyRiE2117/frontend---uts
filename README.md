☕ Sistem Manajemen Kafe

A web-based cafe management system built for the midterm project by Ariandaru Kusuma Yudha (22.01.55.3012).
This system provides a user-friendly interface for managing cafe operations, including master data, transactions, inventory, and employee shifts — all in one dashboard.

🧭 Overview

Sistem Manajemen Kafe is designed to simplify the management of cafe activities through a modern web UI.
It integrates a RESTful API backend (powered by a PHP API) with an interactive frontend using:

HTML5 & CSS3 (for layout and design)

Bootstrap 4 (for responsive styling)

Font Awesome (for icons)

jQuery & DataTables (for dynamic table data and API interaction)

This project supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for various entities, making it easy to manage data efficiently.
